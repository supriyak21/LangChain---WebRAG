LangChain LiveQA is an intelligent question-answering system that bridges the gap between Large Language Models and real-time information. By combining GPT-4's natural language understanding with live web data retrieval through LangChain's agent framework, the system provides accurate, up-to-date responses to user queries through an intuitive web interface.

✨ Key Features

Real-Time Information Retrieval: Fetches current data from the web for time-sensitive queries
Intelligent Context Processing: Uses GPT-4 to understand and synthesize information
Web Content Extraction: Automatically scrapes and processes relevant web pages
User-Friendly Interface: Clean, responsive Streamlit web application
RAG Implementation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with live web data instead of static documents


🏗️ Architecture
The system integrates three core components:

Streamlit Web Interface: Provides an interactive front-end for user queries
LangChain Agent Framework: Orchestrates the interaction between GPT-4 and web search tools
Dynamic Retrieval Pipeline: Fetches and processes real-time information from web sources


Technology Stack

LangChain: Framework for LLM application development

GPT-4: OpenAI's advanced language model for response generation

SerpAPI: Google search API for structured search results

BeautifulSoup: HTML parsing and content extraction

Streamlit: Web application framework



 Project Walkthrough
 
1. Query Processing
When you submit a question, LangChain LiveQA:

Analyzes the query using the LangChain agent
Determines if web search is needed for current information
Constructs optimized search queries

2. Information Retrieval
The system then:

Performs Google searches via SerpAPI
Retrieves top 3 relevant results
Extracts and cleans content from each webpage
Limits content to 1500 characters per source for optimal processing

3. Response Generation
Finally, GPT-4:

Synthesizes information from multiple sources
Generates a comprehensive, contextual answer
Presents the information in a clear, conversational format
